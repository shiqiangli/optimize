The initial version was implemented by internet user (http://blog.csdn.net/emiyasstar__/article/details/6938608), and I just format the code at first step. This version uses just a float number encode.
Next, I will develop the GA to support many other encode/ decode algorithm, and support other selection/ Mutation operator.
In the future, more examples that using GA will be implemented.
Specially, Variable-length Chromosomes for Encoding should be supported.
